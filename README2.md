# Neural Network from Scratch: Digit Recognition

This project implements a multi-layer perceptron neural network from scratch in Python to classify handwritten digits from the [MNIST dataset](#MNIST-dataset). The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts by building the model without using deep learning libraries.
